## Week 7
| **Week** | **Activity** | **Teams Involved** |
| --- | --- | --- | 
| [ ] | Coordinate x.y.0-beta.0 release, ensuring master-blocking are 100% green if possible (this release is not an official beta, just an artifact of the release process), and any flakes are being actively worked by SIGs since this is a chance to look at CI signal. The release-x.y branch is created automatically as a part of the beta.0 release. The Branch Manager now begins daily fast-forwards. | CI signal<br>SIGs<br>Branch Manager |
| [ ] | The burndown templates should be useful at this point since it starts asking about status relevant to each area now tracking (e.g. branch health, docs, communications, issues, etc.) | |

| [ ] | SIGs that have not completed release themes should be contacted again, with a focus on explaining why this matters to the community | SIGs |
| [ ] | Ping role leads reminding them to start considering succession plans. If they are handing the role off to a successor, identifying them early gives more time for the committed volunteer to get targeted mentoring. | Role Leads |
